"Hello, I have two questions:

1.In the custom rendering, it seems that Vue's unmount hooks, 'onUnmounted' and 'onBeforeUnmount', are not working. I'm using 'onLoop', and when I navigate to another page and then return, it creates a new 'onLoop' which runs alongside the previous one, including the 'onLoop' inside 'useFBO'. Currently, I can only unmount them by using 'onLoop.off' at the root canvas component.
2.I am using version 3.5.1, and I've noticed significant frame drops with touch and other events. I'm not sure if this has been optimized in newer versions.
3.I encounter a problem when using 'Tres' on two different pages. When I navigate from page 1 with 'tres' to page 2 with 'tres', nothing is displayed. However, if I go from page 1 with 'tres' to page 3 without 'tres', and then to page 2 with 'tres', this problem does not occur."
